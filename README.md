# CUREMentoring

The Bioconductor project has partial support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
in a Diversity and Inclusiveness special program.

A brief summary of the project [is available](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-sustaining-a-worldwide-community-of-genome-data-scientists/).  A main objective of
the project is the production of open-source teaching materials that can
be used for the engagement of high-school and undergraduate student
from underrepresented communities
in cancer data science.

This site has been created to help encourage scientists at Channing Division of Network Medicine
and Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health to consider participating in the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer
[YES for CURE](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/yes-for-cure/)
mentoring program.
